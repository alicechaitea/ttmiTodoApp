Suggested Improvements:
- Passwords are not secured, at least there should be one capital letter,
lower case letter, a number, and a special character where the total
character count should not be lower than 8
- All elements should include a unique ID to accommodate testing automation
- Unify format of text throughout the app for an enhanced professional look
- Add a brief explanation regarding the app for users
- Schedule a routine code refactoring slot for the development team
